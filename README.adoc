= Arcade

Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of
player scores.

The graphic libraries and the games are implemented as dynamic libraries, loaded at runtime.
Each GUI available for the program are used as a shared library that will be loaded and used dynamically by the main
program.
